# VDHL Entity Builder
## https://tonyquezada.github.io/vhdl-entity-builder/

**VHDL Entity Builder** is a simple and efficient app to help you start your VHDL projects. Inspired by Xilinx's New Source Wizard for VHDL modules, the app allows you to:
1. Define an **entity name**.
2. Define an **architecture name**.
3. Add **ports**, selecting whether they're inputs or outputs. You can also convert ports into buses and define their size.
4. Finally, you can either **save your code** as a `.vhd` file or **copy it to the clipboard** for quick access
